**Problem Statement:**

Now we are in the Information/Internet Age. Most of the Information is available over the internet. 
             As Students want to learn more in this tech era. So, there should be change in how a faculty/teacher teach to their students. 
             So, Students want the time of faculty/teacher to ask their questions and to share their point/thoughts on a particular topic.
             But most of the time Faculties are busy in Syllabus Completion, Taking Attendance and Maintaining Note and in Preparing the Question Papers for
             the exams and in making the report cards.So, students are not getting more time with faculty/teacher to clear the doubts and to extend their 
             imagination level.
             
**Solution:**    
To solve the above problem statment. We have Come up with the Java StandAlone Desktop Application. That Helps the Faculty to do the tasks that they do
             repeatedly so that they can more focus on the students instead of maintaining paper work and other adminstrative work. 
             So, Java StandAlone Desktop Application consists of three Modules
             1. Teaching Schedule
             2. Question Paper Generation
             3. Report card Geneartion

**Teaching Schedule:**

            In this, Faculty can view the Teaching Schedule and can Edit it. So it reduces the paper work of the faculty. So it is like date vs topic mapping. Addition
            to that Each topic is like a url to the Notes of that topic. Faculty just click a particular topic and then he/she gets the notes of that topic so that       
            faculty can revise the concepts and clear the doubts of the student on a click. 
            
**Question Paper Generation:**

            In this, Faculty can generate the Question Paper on a button click. So here the set of the questions are defined and classified based on marks.
            when faculty clicks on the generate question paper. for a particular subject. Question paper is generated with standard pattern with the logo and name 
            of the institution. so that faculty can print out word documents and conduct the test/exam.
            
**Report Card Generation:**

            In this, Faculty can generate the Report Card on a button click. So here Faculty adds the Student Details and marks obtain in the Exam.
            Based on the marks remarks are automatically added. Once the faculty clicks on generate report card after entering the student details. 
            All the report cards are generated in word document. now faculty can distribute the marks sheet by just printing it. it reduces the paper work.
            Report card is generated in the standard format.
            
            
**Technologies Used:**

1)Java 11 - Programming Language
2)Swing - Library for developing java desktop application
3)Apache POI - Library for handling the Word Document
4)Microsoft Tools- For Designing and Analysis of the Application
5)Eclipse IDE- Integrated Development Envinorment used for Developing the Application


**Todo List:**

1)To move whole application form the File System to the Data base System.
2)To Provide More User Interaction in the application by giving ability to add different standard pattern of Question Papers and Report Cards. 
3)To make it live for the End Users. 
4)To Make User Experience Better.
5)Moving from the Word Document to the PDF format of displaying records. and Also to add the functionality of importing the data from the excel sheet into the application 
6) And exporting the data into the Excel sheet from the application.
